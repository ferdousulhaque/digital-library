## Run the app


## CI/CD

## Features

- Built-in Cache Aside Policy with Redis Cache, hence once a get query is called, it will be cached for the next call.


## Scale the application

## Future Improvements

- For fulltext search, ElasticSearch is very much popular. Due to time contraints and memory requirements avioded using it. However, as I have used ORM, implementing it should not be a hassle.

- Writing more test cases
- Adding Swagger to the application
- If time available would implement the JSON Schema validator to show if specific key validation failed or not
- Would add pagination to the get books endpoints
